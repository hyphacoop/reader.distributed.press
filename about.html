        Social Reader is a P2P and offline ActivityPub client for reading and
        following microblogs on the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional platforms, Social Reader does not index data on a
        server. It empowers you to load public ActivityPub data directly,
        turning your device into a personal indexer. This means
        <b>your content, your control</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social Reader natively supports content loading over P2P protocols such
        as
        <code><a href="https://ipfs.tech/">ipfs://</a></code> and
        <code><a href="https://holepunch.to/">hyper://</a></code
        >. This innovation bypasses the need for always-online HTTP servers,
        allowing you to access content anytime, anywhereâ€”even offline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social Reader is built on principles of low-tech; minimal dependencies,
        vanilla JavaScript, unminified scripts, and IndexedDB for local data
        storage. View and contribute to our open-source code on

        <summary>How do I create an account on Social Reader?</summary>
        <p>
          Social Reader is designed as a reading and following client, which
          means you cannot create an account directly within the app. To
          actively write and contribute to the Fediverse, you would need to
          interact with the

          API. This can be done through platforms like
          <a href="https://sutty.nl/">Sutty CMS</a> or by forking and hosting
          your own instance of
          <a href="https://github.com/RangerMauve/staticpub.mauve.moe"

          Why is Social Reader different from mainstream social platforms?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Social Reader eliminates the middleman, ensuring direct communication
          with your audience without the interference of third-party algorithms.
          This ad-free experience prioritizes user autonomy and engagement,
          making it ideal for community leaders and organizations seeking
          genuine reach and engagement. Unlike traditional social networks where
          follower engagement often requires payment, Social Reader and the
          broader Fediverse allow for genuine reach and engagement.
